<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This document outlines the procedure for granting an API developer access to
  Apigee.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
  Before granting access to a user, ensure that the TeamDynamix request has been
  processed and approved by the API Directory / Service Management team.
</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Procedure</h2>
<p>
  Once an API developer access request has been approved, the developer should
  be added to the <strong>apidir-developers@umich.edu</strong> MCommunity group. Membership to
  this group will grant the user access to the
  <a href="https://apigee.google.com">Apigee Console</a>, where they will be
  able to develop and test new API proxies.
</p>
<p>
  Developers should consult the
  <a href="https://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/3783"
    >API Developer Training Materials</a
  >
  for more information about Apigee X and API development.
