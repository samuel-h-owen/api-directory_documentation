# Features & Benefits

The API Directory streamlines the process for requesting institutional data access. It is approved for sensitive data APIs, including data containing Personal Health Information (PHI) and data regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

## API Directory Portal

The API Directory Portal enables developers & researchers to do the following:

- Browse U-M API products
- Read documentation
- Interactively issue test requests
- Generate stubs of sample code in Java, JS, PHP, Python, and other languages
- Create & manage applications to consume API products
- Create & manage developer teams
- Subscribe to APIs
- Manage application credentials

The API Directory is also available to U-M students, temporary staff, and alumni. These groups will need sponsorship to use the API Directory. Contact the [API Directory Team](apidir-contact@umich.edu) for more information.

## Publish an API

Data owners who are interested in opening data for use by one or more developers may request to [develop & publish an API](https://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/3973) in the directory. As an API developer, you will have tools to audit use, grant or deny access requests, and automate roll-on and roll-off processes. You also have options to create an unlisted API that is accessible only by request.

With the Apigee platform, API developers are able to create API products and have full control over the request/response cycle, including the ability to:

- Design the complete flow throughout the request/response cycle, including payload transformation, authentication, and dynamic routing across multiple backend systems
- Set policies for authentication, rate limiting, and more
- Gain insights into usage patterns for your API and its endpoints
- Provide abstractions over back-end systems through a common interface
- Debug API-related issues via a robust trace tool
